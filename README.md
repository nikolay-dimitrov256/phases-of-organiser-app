### Different phases of an organiser app

In this repository I'll upload my code of an organiser app with different levels of complexity.

**01 todo_list.py** - A simple to do list with command line interface. It stores tasks, but doesn't remember them after the program is shut down.

**02 todo_list_with_save.py** - Same as above, but somewhat usefull, because it stores the data in a text file.

**03 organiser_cli.py** - An organiser, working with a to do list, appointments with a due date, and completed tasks for the day for some (dis)satisfaction.

**04 notifier.py** - A notifier app. It takes the appointments for the day from the save file, and gives the user a reminder when starting the app, and an hour before the appointment time. A good idea would be to make the app start automatically at the boot of the computer.
